So far the best.

- Scalar was implemented in raw features and $\mu, \sigma$ is applied to all of following sub clusters.

        elif (cluster_type == '111123' or cluster_type == '111134'
            or cluster_type == '111233' or cluster_type == '112234'
            or cluster_type == '112333' or cluster_type == '113334'
            or cluster_type == '122334' or cluster_type == '123333'):
